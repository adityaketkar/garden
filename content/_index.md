Hi, I am Aditya 👋 , and you are currently in my second brain. This is where I think out loud, capture raw ideas and make them public. 

There is no featured posts list or a starting point. Just pick something and keep going, from 👉 [here](notes)


I occasionally collate these thoughts into [talks, blogs and a newsletter](notes/talks-blogs-and-newsletter).

PS : I intentionally try to avoid writing about tech here.
